I created the game idea and talked about it to Victor. After I got a green light on my idea, I started coding. I created a base for the game, but it still wasn’t running.

I was coding the whole day. I managed to create something that starts to look like a game. I also decided that I have to comment my code very thoroughly, so I can actually understand it and have my notes always around.

I started to work hard on the drawings. I drew a sprite sheet, started on the background, platforms and the flag.

16.01.2025 (Thursday)
I was coding for a few hours and at some point I started getting errors. I got fed up with the coding part and went back to drawing. I have finished the sprite sheet, platforms and a flag.

I took a day off to clear my mind and rethink what has to be done. I added some finishing touches to the drawings and watched a few tutorials on how to make a platformer game. I also looked up some tips and tricks on how to make my work go smoother.

I was coding the whole day. Managed to create a workable prototype, however at the end of the day it still had some errors.

My code turned out to not be working. I had to basically redo the whole game, which made me very frustrated about this whole project. It took me about 10 hours to put it together. I got inspired by Lucas' template, because I was too scared that if I started from square one I wouldn't make it on time.

I was coding the whole day. I’ve managed to make the sprite sheets work and I finished the collision detection. I also fixed the canvas, so the character doesn’t disappear anymore.

21.01.2025 (Tuesday)
I was coding all day, from early morning till night. I managed to have a working game I was satisfied with. I debugged the code and made it fully workable.

Today I was drawing the whole background. It was very time-consuming, as I wanted to recreate my inspiration as closely as possible. I changed the color of the platforms too, because I was not satisfied with how it looked all together. It was also a wearisome process as I had to go pixel by pixel to make it work.

I made a presentation and practiced my pitch. I added some final touches, like the closing and the opening screen. Also, I ran the final test of the game.

24.01.2025 (Friday)
I presented the short pitch and afterwards I showed the game at the game fair.
